# Missing features
Open-source-server-implementation-of-the-HLA4-Federate-Protocol is currently missing a couple of features that prevent
it from having full Federate Protocol support. These are listed here:

 * Reconnection support ([#6](https://github.com/HLA4FP-Server-Project/Open-source-server-implementation-of-the-HLA4-Federate-Protocol/issues/6))
 * Support for TLS/TCP, Websocket, Secure Websocket ([#18](https://github.com/HLA4FP-Server-Project/Open-source-server-implementation-of-the-HLA4-Federate-Protocol/issues/18))
 * Support for CTRL_SESSION_TERMINATED for graceful disconnections ([#19](https://github.com/HLA4FP-Server-Project/Open-source-server-implementation-of-the-HLA4-Federate-Protocol/issues/19))
 * Full support for all HLA messages ([#5](https://github.com/HLA4FP-Server-Project/Open-source-server-implementation-of-the-HLA4-Federate-Protocol/issues/5))
